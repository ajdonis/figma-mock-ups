# figma-mock-ups

This repository contains some of my project I am currently working on for the Google UX Design certification. There are two PDFs: one for the wire frames and one for a more detailed Homepage.  

Prototype link for the wireframes: https://www.figma.com/proto/mQDpEYFSGBZPM2fed0Ibm0/Lo-fi-mock-ups?node-id=0-1&t=nIbLYo6QXGvTvs2w-1
